We believe in the power of mentorship, and offer help with resume building and mock interviews. \r\n                                We also host tech talks from leading companies in the industry. \r\n                                Most importantly, we’re a group of friends who support each other through and beyond our classes, and look forward to expanding our family!\r\n
